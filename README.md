# GBS SNP Calling Reference Optional Pipeline (GBS-SNP-CROP)

### Introduction
The **GBS** **SNP** **C**alling **R**eference **O**ptional **P**ipeline (GBS-SNP-CROP) is executed via a sequence of [seven Perl scripts][4] that integrate custom parsing and filtering procedures with well-known, vetted bioinformatic tools, giving the user full access to all intermediate files. By employing a novel strategy of SNP calling based on the correspondence of within-individual to across-population patterns of polymorphism, the pipeline is able to identify and distinguish high-confidence SNPs from both sequencing and PCR errors. The pipeline adopts a clustering strategy to build a population-tailored "Mock Reference" using the same GBS data for downstream SNP calling and genotyping. Designed for libraries of either paired-end (PE) or single-end (SE) reads of arbitrary lengths, GBS-SNP-CROP maximizes data usage by eliminating unnecessary data culling due to imposed length uniformity requirements. GBS-SNP-CROP is a complete bioinformatics pipeline developed primarily to support curation, research, and breeding programs wishing to utilize GBS for the cost-effective genome-wide characterization of plant genetic resources, mainly in the absence of a reference genome. The pipeline, however, can also be used when a reference genome is available, either as a standalone analysis or as a complement to reference-based analyses via alternative pipelines (e.g. TASSEL-GBS) or indeed its own reference-independent analysis.

### Pipeline workflow
* **Stage 1. Process the raw GBS data**

*Step 1: Parse the raw reads*  
*Step 2: Trim based on quality*   
*Step 3: Demultiplex*

* **Stage 2. Build the Mock Reference** 

*Step 4: Cluster reads and assemble the Mock Reference*

* **Stage 3. Map the processed reads and generate standardized alignment files**

*Step 5: Align with BWA-mem and process with SAMtools*  
*Step 6: Parse mpileup output and produce the SNP discovery master matrix*

* **Stage 4. Call SNPs and Genotypes**

*Step 7: Filter SNPs and call genotypes*

### Getting Help
Initially, go carefully through the [GBS-SNP-CROP User manual][2]. Before post a question or start a discussion, please check your barcode ID file for empty characters or blank spaces and verify that it was saved as a tab-delimited file and also see the [FAQ page][17]. If you're still facing an issue, please, submit it on our discussion [Google groups page][5].
